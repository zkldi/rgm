# Rust TGM

This is a clone of TGM1 built with Rust. I built this to learn Rust, don't take it seriously.

It's not pretty, and it's not intended to actually be played seriously - it's only the bare minimum to be a clone.

## Instructions

`cargo run`

WASD to move, HJK to rotate (CCW, CW, CCW), TGM style.

## Features

- ARS
- Grades
- TGM style gravity

## Antifeatures

- Center Column Rule isn't implemented, which means you can do techs that are impossible in the real game.
- Timers arent implemented so you can't actually get GM nor can you see how fast you're going.
- I left the starting level at 500 because I was playing 20G and really if you're good at the game there's no reason to play anything else so like maybe you should just get better?

## Important

**I BUILT THIS TO LEARN Rust. THE CODE IN HERE IS NOT OF ANY QUALITY, AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A REFERENCE.**

If you're anything like me, you've probably stumbled on this repo because you were looking for implementations of tetris in Rust, perhaps to learn Rust yourself.

Please do not use this codebase as a reference. I'm also learning Rust here.
